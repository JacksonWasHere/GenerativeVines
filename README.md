# Generative Vines

This program generates different types of vines. The basic algorithm works as follows; first we have a parent dot.
This parent will have a direction that it will move in while being continuosly drawn. This results in a straight line or curved depending on settings. Everytime a dot is drawn it has a chance to produce a child dot with parent size - 1. The child will be given a random direction based off of the parent direction. The child will then behave in the same manner as a parent. The dots generating children can create cool vine and crystal looking formations.
